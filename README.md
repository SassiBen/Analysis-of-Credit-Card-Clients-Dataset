# Analysis of Credit Card Clients Dataset

## Authors
- Benalouache Sassi

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a credit card clients dataset from Taiwan, covering the period from April 2005 to September 2005. The aim is to understand the dynamics of credit behavior among consumers.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 25 variables related to clients' credit and payment history, such as credit limit, gender, education, marital status, age, repayment status, bill amounts, and payment amounts.

## Key Findings
- Analysis of correlations between various variables such as repayment status, bill amounts, and credit limit.
- Identification of a positive correlation between repayment status and the likelihood of defaulting the next month.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removal of anomalies in billing and payment records.
- Corrections in payment amounts and normalization of repayment statuses.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Graphviz
- **Machine Learning Models and Evaluation**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), LightGBM, various evaluation metrics
- **Data Preprocessing**: StandardScaler
- **Sampling Techniques for Imbalanced Data**: SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler
- **Model Tuning and Validation**: GridSearchCV, train_test_split
